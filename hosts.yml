# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Top level entries are assumed to be groups, start with 'all' to have a full hierarchy
#   - Hosts must be specified in a group's hosts:
#     and they must be a key (: terminated)
#   - groups can have children, hosts and vars keys
#   - Anything defined under a host is assumed to be a var
#   - You can enter hostnames or IP addresses
#   - A hostname/IP can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, put them in 'all' or 'ungrouped' group
